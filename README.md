# Nautilus Fork

This is my own custom fork of Nautilus that addresses some issues I have with the official version.

Changes in this fork are as follows:

- Remove "Starred" and "Recent" from the sidebar
- Change available zoom levels slightly
- Make it so images and videos display their thumbnails at all zoom levels
- Remove border from image thumbnails
- Slightly change film borders on video thumbnails

## Installing

To install this fork, do the following commands in your terminal (this will replace any already-installed version of Nautilus):

1. `git clone https://github.com/cheesits456/Nautilus.git`
2. `cd Nautilus`
3. `./build.sh` (will ask for root password)
4. `cd ..`
5. `rm -rf Nautilus`
