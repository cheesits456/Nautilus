# Nautilus Fork

This is my own custom fork of Nautilus that addresses some issues I have with the official version.

Changes in this fork are as follows:

- Remove "Starred" and "Recent" from the sidebar
- Change available zoom levels slightly
- Make it so images and videos display their thumbnails at all zoom levels
- Remove border from image thumbnails
- Slightly change film borders on video thumbnails
